##  Project Overview

This project aims to identify and predict future bike accident hotspots in Amsterdam using advanced spatial clustering and machine learning techniques. Leveraging real accident data from 2021â€“2023, the project provides actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and the public to improve cycling safety in the city.

---

##  Objectives

- **Detect spatial clusters (hotspots) of bike accidents** using HDBSCAN.
- **Predict future accident hotspots** by combining spatial and contextual features (weather, road, light, outcome).
- **Visualize accident clusters and predictions** with both static and interactive maps.
- **Aggregate and analyze cluster-level information** to inform safety interventions.
- **Summarize key findings and suggest future improvements** for data-driven urban safety.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source:** `data/cleaned/gdf_ams_21_23.csv`
- **Description:** Contains all bike accidents in Amsterdam (2021â€“2023) with the following columns:
  - `longitude`, `latitude`
  - `weather_conditions`
  - `road_conditions`
  - `light_conditions`
  - `outcome` (injury severity)
  - `street_name`
  - (and other relevant features)

**Note:** All analyses and visualizations in this project are based solely on this dataset.

##  Methodology

1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
   - Notebook: [`notebook/01_gdf_ams_cleaning.ipynb`](notebook/01_gdf_ams_cleaning.ipynb)
   - Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure correct data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Notebook: [`notebook/02_EDA.ipynb`](notebook/02_EDA.ipynb)
   - Explore spatial and contextual patterns in accident data.
   - Visualize distributions, correlations, and trends.

3. **Spatial Clustering (Hotspot Detection)**
   - Apply HDBSCAN to identify accident clusters/hotspots.
   - Analyze cluster characteristics (center, spread, accident count, common conditions).

4. **Feature Engineering & Prediction**
   - Notebook: [`notebook/03_future_hotspot_prediction.ipynb`](notebook/03_future_hotspot_prediction.ipynb)
   - Encode categorical features (weather, road, light, outcome).
   - Train machine learning models to predict future hotspot risk.

5. **Visualization**
   - **Static Maps:** Matplotlib/Seaborn plots for publication-ready visuals.
   - **Interactive Maps:** Folium maps with:
     - All accident points
     - Cluster centers
     - Interactive popups (risk level, prediction score, accident count, top streets, etc.)
     - Color-coded risk levels (red/orange/yellow)
     - Legends and detailed tooltips
   - Example outputs:
     - [`amsterdam_bike_accidents_cluster.html`](amsterdam_bike_accidents_cluster.html)
     - [`hotspot_clusters_map.html`](hotspot_clusters_map.html)
     - [`future_hotspots_21_23.png`](future_hotspots_21_23.png)

6. **Cluster Analysis & Reporting**
   - Aggregate and summarize cluster-level statistics.
   - Markdown summaries of key findings and recommendations.

##  Key Findings

- Several persistent accident hotspots were identified, often correlated with specific weather, road, and light conditions.
- Machine learning models using spatial and contextual features improved hotspot prediction accuracy.
- Interactive maps enable detailed exploration of risk factors and cluster characteristics.

---

##  Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional features (e.g., traffic volume, time of day, infrastructure data).
- Develop temporal models for real-time or seasonal hotspot prediction.
- Integrate live data feeds for dynamic dashboards.
- Expand to other cities or regions for comparative analysis.
